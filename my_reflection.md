Explain how to create a repository on GitHub and clone the repository to your local computer to a non-technical person.

navigate to the repository where you want to push, pull, etc your files. copy that url. navigate in the terminal to an appropriate folder (not one that is already a repository) and type in "git clone urlname" After that create a branch so that you are not manipulating the master.

Describe what open source means.
open source is when you share a computer program for free and allow anyone to use it or add to it or change it to how they want to.

What do you think about Open Source?
Does it make you nervous or protective? Does it feel like utopia?
I think is extremely important. We have a lot of resources that wouldn't available to help alot of people if they weren't open sourced. It allows people to help each other, and I for one will probably definitely need help! Its definitely a utopia in my book because of its usefulness.

Assess the importance of using licenses
Bottom line it informs people and other users about what they can and can't do with someone's work depending on the type of license that they have.

What concepts were solidified in the challenge? Did you have any "aha" moments? What did you struggle with?
How to make a repo was solidified in this challenge. While I was struggling through making my own repository, I realized the proper way of creating a repo, I had mede the mistake of just making a directory that was titled with my usrname and github.io and that was completely wrong. I figured that out when I tried to use git on it and it wasn't even a repo! I get it now!

Did you find any resources on your own that helped you better understand a topic? If so, please list it.
I used resources that were given and watched the fork and clone video again.
