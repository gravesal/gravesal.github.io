      Like any other career field, the technology field has its pros and cons. One could only hope that the wonderful realm of programming was immune to the troubles that plague its own 'supercless,' the tech field, but that would be a waste of time, when instead we could be educating ourselves about those problems and find ways to approach them head on in order to find solutions. One issue that we are going to discuss at the moment is diversity. Thats right folks, it may seem played out, but it is very much a big player in the issues that plague the tech industry. Diversity serves as a great advantage to the industry and having members that represent many facets of the community can only help to strengthen the products that we the industry yields.

In addressing Troubles in diversity, lets take a look at a few of the big issues with diversity as it stands today. One is the problem of exposure. We know that women and minorities are underrepresented in this field and some of that can be attributed not only to their low level of exposure with tech related studies at schools, when they are young, but also the company cultures that are present at some tech companies. At times when people of diverse backgrounds work at tech compaines they can't help but feel as if they don't belong, whether it be covertly  or overtly, ranging from unconscious division in work meetings to salary pay gaps. There have been cases of online bullying of diverse groups, more notably, women, who have endured harrassment and faced tough decisions about how to go on with their career. One way to combat these problems could perhaps lie in hiring more diverse employees and create a company culture that is welcoming to people of all backgrounds, reiterating that their individual experience matters. Taking the tech to the people instead of letting the people come to the tech may also be a solution for people of diverse backgrounds to gain access into the tech industry.

      Another issue worth mentioning that has cause trouble when it comes to diversity is the way that candidates are hired. Employers take into account a woman's age and marraige status to see if they will have to provide her with paid time off in the event that she decides to have a child. Other aspects like personal interviews may cause biases to occur where the employers may be more likely to hire someone that reminds them of themselves instead of someone who may stir the pot and add diversity to ranks. Some of these may be done unconciously but they are done nonetheless and harm the diversity of the tech industry. There have been some new implementations of interview procedure that takes these issues into account so that they can protect potential employees from these unfair biases.
    </p>
     <p>
      Although it may seem like full solutions to these problems are far off, as long as we are moving towards a working solution to enhance the diversity of the tech field, we can do our best to be as culturally aware as possible. Afterall, its not always about the technology, but the people behind it making it great for the whole world to use!
