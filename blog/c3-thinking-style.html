  <h1>Gregorc Thinking Style</h1>
  <h2>Concrete, Abstract, Sequential, and Random</h2>
  <h4>June 27, 2015</h4>

    <p>
      Gregorc's Thinking styles are made of up a Perceptual Quality paired with an Order Ability. The pairs create four distict categories: Concrete Sequential, Abstract Sequential, Conrete Random, and Abstract Random. A person isn't just funneled into a single category, but can, and are expected to be in more than one category. Concrete learners prefer literal, direct communication about a topic,whereas an abstract learner can learn conceptually. As for the Ordering Ability, people who lean towards learning sequentially, thrive by approaching the material in a step y by step manner as opposed to learning in chunks and in an impulsive manner.   </p>

      My thinking styles included Abstract Sequential, Concrete Random, and Abstract Random. Its alot, I know! But because I am so versatile, the DBC experience has catered to my learning needs in more ways than one. I worked alone on some of the challenges, which is supposed to be one of the ways that Abstract Sequential Thinkers learn best. DBC also caters to my Concrete Random Thinking Style by allowing us to work on challenges that instruct us to do outside research on our own and complete challenges by trial and error, which has been shown to be one of the best ways to learn for this style of thinkers. Lastly, as an Abstract Random Thinker, one of the best ways to learn is by participating in group activities. I am able to exercise this method of learning whenever I work with others through peer pairing.  Overall, I am able to use my thinking styles to my advantage in DBC especially since DBC incorporates many ways of reaching all types of learners in their curriculum, and because I am very versatile, I can more than likely always use one of my thinking styles to my advantage!

      The biggest struggle I have had so far has been managing my time. A big part of it has been my job. I'm at work for 45 hours a week and then add an hour and a half for traveling so you can see that my time blocks are pretty limited. To combat that, one thing I have to figure out is how to effectively use the pomodoro method. I just always feel like if I work for just "5 more minutes" then I can figure out what will make my code work. I think I need to break that habit and just let some things go and move on. If and when time permits, I will go back to fix it and work on it more. Something I can do to help break that habit is make very strict schedules for myself so that it becomes impossible to deviate from my Pomodoro method. For instance I can wake up an hour early and work on it before work and then when that hour is up, I must stop and go to work. That also will give me time to think about other approaches while I am away from the code.

      A part of using Thinking Styles to my learning advantage includes paring them with a growth mindset. Some things that can help expand the way I think and learn throughout this whole experience, and to last after, is to get in the habit of always approaching challenges ready to learn something new. Another thing I can implement, is taking a break BEFORE I get discouraged. I think there is a threshhold of mini disappointments I can endure before I get totally bogged down, and because I can recognize that, I think a wise thing to do would be to take a break before full blown defeat sets in. I think it would keep me motivated to complete a challenge and still be confident in my skills. During my break, I could research my problem and then take a mini break to do something else maybe coding related and then come back after my disappoint threshhold has been reset.
