      Have you ever heard the saying "There is no such thing as a stupid question"? Well, that may be true, if you know HOW to ask said question. There is an art to asking questions that yield the answers we are looking for. It requires that the inquirer have a bit of skill when phrasing and posing the question. Including relevant information to slim down possible irrelevant responses from both people and search engines. Lets go through some pieces of advice to enhance the quality and accuracy of our responses.
    </p>

    <p>
      After analyzing some of the questions fromt the Google+ community, I have seen several good examples of questions as well as a couple bad examples and would like to highlight the components of each.
    </p>

    <p>
      The examples of good questions had qualities that included good syntax and grammar which probably meant that they looked over their post and proofread their code or question before posting it. Their post also included enough information in it, so that people could understand what their code and question was relevant to. The code was readable and did not include any typos and unnecesary comments.
    </p>

    <p>
      Examples of poor questions had unclear questions, and they were much to broad. Some times, people had to ask clarifying questions in order to get a better idea of what the problem was, and in this case, that was a waste of time and correspondence. The person who posed the question probably would like to save time and solve their issue as quickly as possible, but because their question was unclear and muddled, it took even longer to get the answers they were looking for.

    </p>

    <p>
      All in all, asking questions the right way can save time, energy, and coding solutions, when asked properly, and can cause more confusion and stress, when posed poorly. Learning how to ask questions clear and well is an invaluable skill that reaches beyond the classroom, and can help speed along understanding for those looking for clarification.
