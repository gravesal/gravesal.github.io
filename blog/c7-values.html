  <h1>Combatting Stereotype Threat</h1>
  <h2> Remember Your Values </h2>
  <h4>August 3, 2015</h4>

  <section>
    <p>
      We all know that stereotypes exist and no matter how hard we try, we cannot ignore that they negatively affect millions of people every day across the globe. So one thing we can equip ourselves with to manage these situations when they arise is a plan to combat stereotype threat using our own personal values.
    </p>

    <p>
      One value that I find particularly important to me is close relationships. I have alaways been very personable and interested in developing relationships with those I interact with. I tend to care very much about first impressions and I try very hard to put my best foot forward. Because of this desire to interact well with others and develop a sense of community with the people around me, I have been able to develop an intuition about people's intentions when we interact. I can tell whether or not people are genuinely interested in developing a more meaningful relationship of substance or if they are willing to have a down to earth conversation or even if they are jsut interested in getting work done and keep things moving. In any case, my aim is to please and to build a good rapport with them in hopes of developing strong ties and networking. These are the types of interactions that make a person memorable and likable, and that is something I have always strove for in my introductions and conversations with others.
    </p>

    <p>
      Because this value of close relationships ties so closely with my personality, I feel  this aspect draws people towards me for advice about interpersonal interaction. One of the last topics that someone asked me for advice about was how to deal with integrating into a new place. A friend of mine is moving to a completely new place and is anxious about making new friends and fearing that she won't be a part of the community at her new job. Naturally, friends would be the facet to turn to, but the advice I gave was about getting her to make great impressions on her new community and to let them get a ginuine read of her and for her to try to do the same. Generally, I have noticed that judgement of character takes place within the first few interactions, and some transparency can pay off in spades when it comes to developing new relationships.
    </p>

    <p>
      Whenever I consider my value of developing close relationships, I feel empowered to know that I have the ability to connect with others on a personal level and appreciate that I am unafraid of trying to get to know others beyond face value. Not only can this help me avoid stereotyping others, but can also assist me in managing and avoiding stereotype threat. When I feel targeted, I know that I can rely on my skills of being down to Earth with others and just have a straightforward conversation with them about any ideas they may have about me. Its an opportunity to educate others about people's individual qualities and the different aspects that make up a person. Having tough conversations is one of the best things we can do to dispel stereotype threat!
