  <h1>Stereotype Threat</h1>
  <h2> </h2>

    <p>
      We all have second guessed ourselves before or felt like we were unable to accomplish something we really cared about. That is a part of life, and can happen at any time, but there is such a thing as having that feeling subconscouisly manifested without a person even realizing it taking place. Its occurence not only has the ability to handicap performance, but can be brought on by a fear of being associated with a social group that is deemed as incapable or inferior to others. Stereotypes, as most people know, can be negative or positive, and the action of categorizing someone in a stereotype or expecting them to adhere to certain stereotypes has been shown to have adverse effects on individuals.

      I am referring to what is known as stereotype threat. Stereotype threat is formally defined as "a situational predicament in which people are or feel themselves to be at risk of confirming negative stereotypes about their social group." This can cause major complications when an individual is in a situation in which they are evaluated with other peers and have to be reminded of their social group before they are to perform the task. A familiar example that has actually happened to me has been while I was taking my end of the year assessments in elementary school. On more than one occasion, I remember asking the teacher why the assessment needed to know what race I was, and why did it matter. I was actually bothered about why that was even asked. Why were they going to rank us? That was so aggravating to me and for the first half of the test, it would be in the back of my head, just bothering me.

      A second example I experienced was when I I played sports with my friends. They always wanted me on their team, assuming I was a "speed demon." The truth was I was not a very impressive runner by my own standards, but when I would race the other kids, I ended up pushing myself super hard to fulfil their expectations and typically confirmed that I was fairly athletic. They then would always pick me to be on their teams so maybe that encouraged me to stick to sports and be as good as people thought I was. All that to say, these stereotypes can work in different ways but generally stereotype threat yields negative results. One of my most memorable negative stereotype threats I confirmed happened during my Freshman year of college. I chose to take a math level course that advisors said was doable, but was typically harder for students with a limited mathematical background. I felt that my skills were fairly good, and that I was a fast learner. While in the class, I just kept thinking that my math skills weren't up to par with everyone else's and ended up failing the course. The work was doable and I did very well on quizzes, but when it came to exams, I would freeze up and watch how fast everyone wlse would fly through the problems. I think I just figured that I really was behind because it took me so long to solve the problems.

      I think something that could really help reduce stereotype threat bias would be personal mindset. I think recognizing it is important so that an individual can be aware that they may be under its influence. Once they have identified it, they can reset their mind to acknowledge that they are as able and knowlegeable to do anything and everything that they were capable of before that experience of stereotype occurred. Activley setting the environment with the intention of avoiding stereotype bias could improve one's productivity and increase one's self esteem as well.
