  <h1>The DBC Experience</h1>
  <h2></h2>
  <h4>June 15, 2015</h4>

  <section>
    <p>
      The DBC experience is not just an opportunity to learn how to program, its the chance to grow as a person, not only in the programming world, but in the real world. We are learning to learn for the rest of our lives. We are here to learn code yes, and that entails continuing the programming education even after we land jobs, but as an individual, one should strive for life-long learning. Approaching things we don't understand, just so we can tackle it and see just how much we can learn from something, is one of the best ways to build your knowledge.

    </p>
    <p>
        I believe that one of the key aspects of the DBC experience is attacking issues head on. This is an approach that can be adapted in many facets of our non-programming lives, and that is one of the goals of DBC: to make us better learners and better people overall. My impression of DBC is that this will be a place where the teachers are just as enthusiastic about learning as we are. I believe every person will have something to contribute to every one else's DBC experience, especially since we will be struggling through this all together. Despite not feeling like the smartest person in the room, learning from failure is still a viable option for creating a path to success.

    <p>
        The culture of learning is what drives DBC and I intend on engaging in this by any means necessary whether it be engaging in offic hours, choosing to get to spend time with my cohort members outside of class, taking the time to rework challenges that I hadn't done so well on intially, etc. Learning how to learn is a task in itself, but once that is done, continuing to feed the drive for more knowledge becomes second nature. Going that extra distance for understanding or reaching out for help is something that I am more than willing to do because I know that this is important to me and the people that are learning from me in return.
    </p>
    <p>
      My expectations of DBC haven't really changed much. I expect people to struggle sometimes, and for people to have "aha" moments. I realize that its more of a community now so that makes me feel a little more comefortable, however I am still a litte nervous about falling behind, but if it happens, it will be a learning opportunity so bring it on! I am beyond excited to experience this kind of learning environment, especially since I know there will be lots of help when I am working on improving myself.
