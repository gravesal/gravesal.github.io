    <p>The task of peer pairing with others was one that I always look forward to. I'm a really social person who like to crack a lot of jokes, so for me its not just an opportunity to learn and work together but a chance to have fun and break up the monotony of my day Overall, I think pairing is a one of the most valuable tools andmethods of DBC's teaching style. </p>

    <p>Getting to pair is one of my favorite aspects of our curriculum, and I feel like the extra added edge of working on a team helps mefocus and perform better. So far my peer paring experience has been really positive. Although there have been times when guided pairing sessions were a bit more serious, I still managed to work through challenges with my peer pair with a still happy go lucky feel, and avoiding getting frustrated with code. </p>

    <p> I'm not one to toot my own horn but, I am a really fun pair judging by the feedback I've read and that is something I really take pride in. I'd say that I work just as hard to find solutions with my pair as I do to have a nice time with my pair. Who would want all work and no play? That would make the session boring. If the session can be memorable and pleasant, then perhaps the material learned during that session will be remembered more easily and with pleasant co-memories to accompany it. After reading the feedback, I feel that my approach has been well received.</p>

  </p> The constructive feedback I have received have mostly been recommended that I slow down and take my time when approaching the challenges because I sometimes go too fast and miss details I think that is fair because I know I am generally one to just go, go , go and try to be as efficient as possible with my time. Another suggestion has been to embrace breaks while coding. I know that I have a tendency to get carried away when working on a challenge so taking a break to help clear my mind would be really helpful. Taking the feedback into account, I think I will make a new goal to strive towards going through each challenge thoroughly and reading each release before the pairing session starts as well marking ahead of time, where I will take a break based upon estimations of where I think difficulties may arise. A method like that could help prepare for each part of a challenge as well as encourage me to take a break when those difficult moments arise. </p>

  <p> Writing feedback for others has been an enlightening experience. Not only do I feel like I am evaluating the success of our pairing and acknowledging their growth as a programmer, but I am reminded of the difficulties that we struggled through and overcame together. An important aspect of writing good feedback is actionable items that will allow them to quantifiably improve their skills. This is probably the most difficult portion of writing feedback. Although there is always room for improvement, depending on what the material is, our pair may not exhibit certain areas of improvement that may have otherwise been visible and apparent. Writing feedback that is kind and specific is a much more doable task, and just as important. </p>
