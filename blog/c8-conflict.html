    <p>Discuss a time you had a conflict. What was it about? What happened?
    </p>

    <p> A conflict that I had was at summer job in an office for a research facility. I was put in charge of managing the sources using a software that only a couple people in the office were familiar with. They understood what the software was for, but were not very knowledgeable about how to use it. We went to training sessions about it and gained the tools we needed to use it, but I was the only one who really had to learn it inside and out since I was in charge of managing all of the sources with the software. Long story short, the training session was not nearly as informative as it needed to be and the training instructor had told us just about everything he knew. So after a couple weeks, it came time for us to start writing grants and getting the sources together, and our sources needed a lot of work done on them before they would be ready. The citation manager had a load of capabilities, but no one had ever kept clean and accurate sources. So when our lead researcher asked me to pull a list of relevant sources for the grant proposalwhich was due in 14 days, I faced a big problem of providing clean accurate sources she was asking for. </p>

    <p> What was the source of the conflict? </p>

    <p>
      The source of the conflict came from my other co-workers putting hundreds of  citiations with inaccurate information into our Citation Manager Library.
    </p>

  <p> What basic emotions did you feel upon analyzing the conflict?</p>

<p> I was overwhelmed with the amount of work to do and annoyed with my co-workers for not being thorough with each citation's information</p>

<p>
What actions did you take to resolve your conflict?
  </p>
<p>
  As the person in charge of the managing all of the sources for the research center, I made a plan to strategically go through and update each one by hand. I did this because it was not only my duty, but I did it so I could get extremely knowledgeable about the software. By the time I was done I knew more about the software than the man who trained us on the software! After that, I created a manual and detailed instructions list for everyone to use when they added to the citation manager library in the future. That manual helped prevent future entries of inaccurate and incomplete sources as well as answered questions about to fix other problems.

</p>

<p>
If you could go back, what would you do differently, if anything?
  </p>

  <p>
    There isn't much I can change. I think I handled it pretty well the first time. I went through the manual with one person who had questions, and since no one else had questions, I just left it at that.
  </p>

  <p>
What did you learn from this experience?
  </p>

  <p>
    I learned how to deal with some one else's problems effectively. My boss's dilemma became my dilemma. I was able to get the task of re-catalogging the entire library in one week and I saved our lead researcher hours of extra work and stress by my meticulous work and possible future fiascos by providing the manual. I learned how to roll with the punches and uphold my role under pressure.
