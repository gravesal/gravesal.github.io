     When dealing with data structures and manipulating containers filled with information, programmers and clients are often concerned with how efficient the program runs. Ideally, software utilizes  algorithms and data structures that get the task done and perform smoothly without running up the memory andusing loads of resources. We want inexpensive solutions that return consistently accurate solutions in the fastest amount of time that the program will allow. This category of inspection is known as Big O Notation. </p>


      <p> Big O Notation is formally defined as the language used to articulate how long an algorithm takes to run. Its used to compare the efficiency of different approaches and solutions to problems. Big O is not usually evaluated with small numbers, but instead with exponentially large amount of data. Programs can be evaluated in both best case scenarios and worst case scenarios. Typically, the client will want to know how the program will work in the worst case scenario so that they can see how reliable the program is and how inefficient the program has the potential to run.
    </p>

    <p>
     Big O takes a couple of factors into account when calculating its value. One of the most important, is the time it takes for the program to fully execute and return manipulated values from  the data. It keeps track of how long it takes to execute the algorithm with a certain n number of elements usually in an array or another type of object container.
    </p>

    <p>
      The best evaluation of Big O is when it is constant. The constant Big O is notated as "O(1)" and means that the algorithm is running in constant time and is extremely fast. Its as efficient as an algorithm can possibly be. After constant time, we then get O(logn) time, which from there it gets progressively worse until you're program is extremely ineficient.
