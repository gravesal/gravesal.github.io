We're all here to learn about programming so let's start with some basics. Let's talk about some of the benefits of version control. Version control is a method of keeping ttrack of changes made to a project/document and the time at which the changes or implementations occured. Version control is basically a time machine for your work which ensures that all of your work that you have ever committed or saved is there as a version of the project you are working on. Git is one platform that works as a form of version control to help collaborators keep track of their changes and save the best versions of their collective work.

        Git helps you to keep track of changes through the commands that are provided. The most important commands are "git add" , "git commit" , and "git push" and all have their role in helping you keep track of the changes you make. Using these commands along with "git status" allow you to see exactly which files you are modifying. "git add" is used to add the file to the stage. "git commit" commits the file to the stage so that it is ready to be pushed to a repo. And finally "git push" allows you to add the changed file to your project. In your gitHub, you can look at when and what changes were made after you pull the request and examine the new file.

        There are plenty of good reasons to use GitHub to store your code, but one of the most important reasons is becasue of its version control capabilities. Developers use version control with Git because it allows themm to revert back to old code if their new code breaks their program. Being able to incorporate new work into the master branch or rake it out, makes your master program less buggy and more eftficient. If one were always adding or making changes to the master, human error alone could make for a lengthy debugging process and also slow down productivity. Having multiple versions and being able to choose the best one and then inteegrate it into the code would allow a developer to be more efficient. This method  of using GitHub to store code is practical because having multiple backups is much better than repeatedly overwriting a single saved file that cannot mark progress or help reveal different methods of trying solutions. If one wanted to rethink a solution and create a new one, GitHub would provide a perfect space for that, whereas traditional saving would not.
