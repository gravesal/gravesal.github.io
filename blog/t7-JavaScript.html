      Over the past six weeks, I have been learning loads about the Ruby language. Its functionality, its properties, and its capabilities as a powerful programming languages have enabled me to create programs that manipulate data easily due to its large repertoire of built-in methods. After being introduced to JavaScript, I have noticed some stark differences and similarities to Ruby that I would love to explore and explain to you. One aspect that is of particular importance is that of Ruby Hashes and JavaScript Objects.
    </p>


      <p>
        After working with JavaScript, there  were times when I found myslef in need of a hash and was pleased to discover that it has a mechanism for achieving the hash's functionality. JavaScript's Object literal enables users to store multiple peices of information about variables and access them accordingly. A formal definition of the object literal is that it is a list of zero or more pairs of property names and associated values of an object, enclosed in curly braces ({}), whereas a hash can be defined as a dictionary-like collection of unique keys and their values.

    </p>

    <p>
      Not only do Ruby hashes have similar functions but they also look similar. Instead of using "=>" to map keys to values, JavaScript must use ":" to map. Another difference between object literals and hashes is how they are accessed. In Ruby, we use indexing and brackets or periods to access the values of the keys, whereas JavaScript must use periods following the object's name to access the values and refers to the keys of these values as properties. Another difference worth discussing is how Ruby allows the keys to be of any data type, but JavaScript only uses variables that have the same character requirements as other variables, however these properties can still map to any data type, as well as functions.
    </p>

    <p>
      An additional functionality that JavaScript Object Literals is that users can create extra properties outside of the initial object declaration by naming the object followed by a period and then including the name of the new property and setting it equal to a value. Its as simple as that when it comes to adding additional information to these hash-like objects. So overall, we can see that these two methods of storing information both have their place in their relative languages and that they have comparable funcionality.
