             <h3> Tips for Success in Topic </h3>

            <ol>
                <li>Always use a semicolon after an argument.</li>
                <li>Make sure data types are corect.</li>
                <li>"Inner Joins" return matching records.</li>
                <li>"Outer joins" do not require each record to have a matching record.</li>
                <li>A left outer join of tables A and B will return all matching records of A and B, as well as any non-matched records from the left table, in this case, A.</li>
                <li>A right outer join of tables A and B will return all matching records of A and B, as well as any non-matched records from the right table, in this case, B.</li>
                <li>A full outer join of tables A and B will return all matching records of A and B, as well as any non-matched records from both tables.</li>
                <li>A self join is merely a join from a table to itself.</li>
